runv is a command line client for running applications packaged according to
the Open Container Format (OCF) and is a compliant implementation of the
Open Container Initiative specification.  However, due to the difference
between hypervisors and containers, the following sections of OCF don't
apply to runV:
    Namespace
    Capability
    Device
    "linux" and "mount" fields in OCI specs are ignored

The current release of "runV" supports the following hypervisors:
    KVM (QEMU 2.0 or later)
    Xen (4.5 or later)
    VirtualBox (Mac OS X)

After creating a spec for your root filesystem, you can execute a container
in your shell by running:

    # cd /mycontainer
    # runv start start [ -b bundle ] <container-id>

If not specified, the default value for the 'bundle' is the current directory.
'Bundle' is the directory where '` + specConfig + `' must be located.`
